    <h2>Easy Tofu Recipe</h2>
    <p>Tofu is one of the most difficult foods to master. When done right it can 
        be a lovely replacement to meat. Tofu is inepensive as well.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>Onion (red onion or shallot</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Raw Cashews</li>
        <li>Coriander Powder</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Kasoori methi</li>
        <li>Extra firm Tofu</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegan Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all the ingredients, except the vegetable oil, 
            tofu, butter, cilantro and salt, into a blender 
            and blitz into a very smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wide saucepan or wok. Add the tomato-onion paste and 
            cook it, covered, over a medium-high flame, stirring frequently, 
            until the moisture is mostly gone, the paste looks darker, and 
            shimmers with oil droplets. The paste should look quite sticky 
            at this point and should not taste raw. 
            This step should take you anywhere from 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2-3 cups of water or vegetable stock, depending on the thickness you 
            want for your curry, along with the tofu cubes. 
            Add salt, stir to mix everything, bring
            back to a boil and cover and cook another five minutes. 
            Stir in the vegan butter.</li>
        <li>Serve hot or warm, garnished with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
